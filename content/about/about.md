Here's a little bit about me: I'm a linguistics graduate from the University of Melbourne, and I live and work on Wurundjeri country. You might've gauged some of my academic interests by [reading](/writing/) my [work](/presentations/), but if not, I'm fascinated by the phonology and semantics of Australian Indigenous languages (particularly those in the Top End), as well as speech processing and theories of morphology and the lexicon. 

In my daily life: I love to walk and be outside; I listen to lots of [jazz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Euo2PLEuU0) and [funk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXcdpPDHzlM) music; I am vegetarian and I like to cook; I prefer to write on a manual [typewriter](https://typewriterdatabase.com/1968-hermes-3000.3943.typewriter) or with a [fountain](https://www.gentlemanstationer.com/blog/2024/4/6/fountain-pen-review-the-curious-case-of-the-lamy-vista) [pen](https://www.twsbi.com/collections/fountain-pens/products/twsbi-eco-glow-green-fountain-pen); I am a satisfied [neovim](https://neovim.io) convert; I quite enjoy [whisky](https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/202641/ardbeg-ardcore); I will always advocate for well-typeset documents; my goal is to meditate and be grateful for something every day.
