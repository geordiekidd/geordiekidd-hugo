I was depressed to hear a few weeks ago of Roberta Flack's passing. It was the first [headline](https://www.theguardian.com/music/2025/feb/24/roberta-flack-soul-and-rb-icon-behind-killing-me-softly-dies-aged-88) I read in the news that morning, to which my only response was to embark on a long, meditative walk with the soundtrack supplied by her first half-a-dozen or so albums. I don't think I have anything to say about her legacy that hasn't already been expressed elsewhere, but I do have some words about her artistry which I thought I'd share here, along with some of her less widely appreciated songs.

At some point in my teenage years, when I listened to a lot of hip hop music, I fascinated myself with the production of 90s and 00s hip hop songs -- in particular, I was interested in where all the samples came from. A frequent bump of mine one month was Lil Kim's [Queen Bitch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8rJ7VZadCGc), which I learnt had sampled Roberta Flack's [Hey, That's No Way to Say Goodbye](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kz38Vxkyow4) (which itself is a beautiful cover of the Leonard Cohen original). If you listen at about 1:50 of the Roberta recording, you can hear the piano phrase that formed the basis of Queen Bitch. It wasn't until perhaps a year or so later until I really got into her sound.

I'm pretty sure my first extended experience with her music was an LP I acquired when looking for samples myself, titled *Quiet Fire* (1971). Despite its importance and popularity, I think this is in all honesty one of her most underappreciated albums. The opening song -- [Go Up Moses][moses] -- is a Roberta Flack original (plus some other writers), and stands out in her discography to me as one of her most sincere recordings. I distinctly remember loving this album, and being routinely distracted from my goal (sampling its contents) by the enchanting sounds it contains. Very gospel. The other stand-out song here is [Sunday and Sister Jones][sunday-sister]. *Quiet Fire* was the album that got me into Roberta in the first place, and for that reason I'll always have a special place for it on my shelf.

But it's not my favourite album of hers. Two years prior in 1969, she released her debut, *First Take*, which I think I also have the LP of somewhere. If you haven't listened to this album, you should do so immediately. If you have and you still don't like it, you must either lack a soul or be allergic to groove. The playing, the singing, the arrangements, the pocket -- all of it is supreme. Ron Carter plays on the whole album, leaving us with iconic basslines like that on the opening track [Compared to What](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDUk9Lsy_yQ) (incredible), or my all-time favourite RF song: [Tryin' Times][tryin-times]. You'd be easily forgiven for thinking that the album is full of Roberta Flack originals; in fact, given the way she sings them, you'd have a hard time believing that they weren't hers to begin with. As far as anyone is concerned, she owns those songs. Her voice on *First Take* is mature, intelligent, precise, relaxed, delicate, rough, big, small, honest, sarcastic, joyful, painful, and makes you feel every feeling you know in just three quarters of an hour. The album is one of those rare works of art that you just know is special, that you just know will never be equalled again. The whole thing is a masterpiece from start to finish, and is probably one of my desert island picks (if someone were so cruel as to make me choose). 

Much of the music that came after *Quiet Fire* -- that is, from *Roberta Flack &amp; Donny Hathaway* (1972) and beyond -- is fairly well known. There are the famous hits, like [Killing Me Softly With His Song](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DEbi_YjpA-Y), [Where Is the Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MBT1neIA0tc), and [Feel Like Makin' Love](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ySlLq9t2qgc), but neighbouring them on the same albums are some equally fantastic songs which just don't seem to get played all that much. For instance, *Feel Like Makin' Love* (the album) is well-known only for the titular song, despite housing plenty of other excellent tracks. The same is true of *Killing Me Softly* (1973). At the bottom of this post is a list of songs which are either completely underrated or which, though liked by fans, are overshadowed by more popular tunes from the same album.

In the end, I wish she had've recorded more jazz and soul and folk -- more stuff like *First Take* and *Quiet Fire*. Lots of the pop music has aged terribly for one reason or another (usually the cheesy production, like the abominations on 1994's *Roberta*), and doesn't do enough justice to the beauty of complexity of her voice. (Not to mention, she's one hell of a pianist!) I can't help but feel she was pushed into recording pop music by the music industry. Perhaps that choice was indeed her own, but even if it were I still couldn't help wonder what might've been. Regardless, she has left us with a lifetime's worth of soul and one of the best discographies of any artist I know. May Her spirit live on in the groove.
