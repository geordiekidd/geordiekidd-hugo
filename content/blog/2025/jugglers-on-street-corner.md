I rode the tram up north to my mother's house, and I saw a man juggling a seven-ball cascade on a street corner. It was at the intersection of two big roads; he was facing away from the traffic. The juggler could manage to get them all airborne though he'd lose control shortly after. He kept doing it, a pile of balls on the floor each time. Something like a week later I saw a juggler on a different corner, westward but not far from *Intersection 1*. He had four pins, and he was juggling in front of the stopped traffic for money. In the same fashion as the first man, <em>Juggler 2</em> couldn't persist through the toss. Was it the same person? I saw him again on my return, after I'd retrieved my groceries. 

Maybe four days after that, I crossed *Intersection 2* again when out for a walk, and I saw them both there. *Juggler 1* and *Juggler 2*. Both practising their juggling on the corner, backs against the traffic, both unsuccessfully executing their routines. I finally had my answer -- they were different men after all. I was reminded by them of Melbourne's iconic Alexandra Parade window washers. You can read a fascinating article about them [here](https://secret-lives-melbourne-washers.shorthandstories.com), which discusses their stories and their philosophies, interspersed with poetry from Wayne (one of the washers). I unfortunately didn't manage to get a picture, so instead I'll show you this empty park bench near my house:

It seems like it'll be a hot weekend coming up. This might be a good opportunity to lock myself in my room and start reading some books I got recently: [Who's Afraid of Gender](https://guardianbookshop.com/whos-afraid-of-gender-9780241595824/?utm_source=editoriallink&utm_medium=merch&utm_campaign=article) by Judith Butler, and [Attrib. and other stories](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/33656486-attrib-and-other-stories) by Eley Williams. In an age where there's a lot of harmful rhetoric about gender, sex, and identity I figured it would be good to educate myself a little bit (I don't think the Eley Williams book applies here).
