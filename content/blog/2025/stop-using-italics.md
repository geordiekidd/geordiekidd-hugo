You start to use them for emphasis, which slowly leads you to rely on them for establishing contrast, which turns them into a vehicle for your intonation. Eventually, each *sentence* becomes *overpopulated* with *emphasis*, rendering the text cheap and slightly condescending. The reader (usually) isn't stupid, so they should be able to work out what's surprising or contrastive on their own. If they can't, or you feel that italics is the only way they'll understand the impact of your point, then you haven't written the thing well enough in the first place.
