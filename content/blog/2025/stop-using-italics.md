  Using italics can be a slippery slope. You start using them for emphasis, which slowly leads you to rely on them for establishing any contrast, which then begins to mimic your intonation. The effect then starts to lose its *meaning* and begins to sound *cheap*. Eventually, each *sentence* becomes *overpopulated* with *emphasis*, and then it comes across as though you're condescendingly lecturing to an idiot, which (in most cases) the reader is not.

<!--I myself am guilty of doing this in the past, but reading back my old university essays I can hear echoing in my ears the advice of my year 11 English teacher: if you need to italicise something to emphasise your point, you didn't write it well enough in the first place.-->
