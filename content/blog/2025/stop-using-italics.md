You start to use them for emphasis, which slowly leads you to rely on them for establishing any kind of contrast, which devolves into a rather lame mimicry of your intonation. Eventually, *each sentence* becomes *overpopulated* with emphasis, rendering the text *cheap* and slightly *condescending*. The reader (usually) isn't stupid, so they should be able to work out what's surprising or contrastive on their own. If they can't, or you feel that italics i the only path to their understanding, then maybe it should be put differently in the first place.
