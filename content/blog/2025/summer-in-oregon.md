It has been a while since I last updated this blog. These past few months really slipped by, somehow. I'm spending my winter in Eugene, Oregon this year (where it is actually summer). I'm here for the biennial [Linguistics Society of America Summer Institute](https://center.uoregon.edu/LSA/2025/), whose theme this time around is *Language in Use*.
