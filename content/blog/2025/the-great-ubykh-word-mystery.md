I want to share a small piece of investigative linguistics I conducted recently. It goes as follows. Not long ago, a couple of months perhaps, I encountered a [page](https://allthingslinguistic.com/post/50939757945/morphological-typology-illustrations-from) on Gretchen McCulloch's _All Things Linguistic_ blog breaking down the major types of morphological structures found in the world's languages. In sane people's terms, this refers to the kinds of word structures that a language has. For example, one language's words might necessarily consist of multiple internal parts, each bit contributing some kind of meaning to the sentence, whilst another language's words may only consist of one part and the order in which you combine the words affects the sentence's meaning.

Exemplified with rather cute illustrations are the types of _Isolating/Analytic_, _Agglutinative_, and _Fusional_. (Illustrations are from SpecGram, originally found [here](https://specgram.com/CLII.3/09.phlogiston.cartoon.3.html).) Analytic languages are those with very simple word structures, like Vietnamese, where each word consists basically of one part. Agglutinative and Fusional languages are synthetic, because the meanings of words emerge from the _synthesis_ of their multiple parts. Agglutinative languages concatenate word-parts together like lego bricks, with each bit typically contributing just one bit of meaning. An example is the Warlpiri noun _maliki-kari-kirlangu_ [dog-another-possessive] 'belonging to another dog'{{< footnote dir=a ref="nash-1980" >}}. In fusional languages, word-parts can express multiple bits of meaning, such as the _-st_ in the German verb _wander-st_ [wander-you.singular.present] '(You sg.) are wandering'.

I encourage you at this point visit the page in question. If you do, and make it to the bottom, you'll find an example of a type of language whose words are of absolutely eye-watering levels of complexity. Ubykh, a Caucasian language formerly spoken in the Caucasus and recorded meticulously by George Dumézil in the 20th century, is a so-called _Polysynthetic_ language, which in this context means that it can express in a word{{< footnote dir=a ref="polysynthesis" >}} what corresponds to an entire sentence in most other languages. The following Ubykh word shows (perhaps the upper limit of) just how complex these languages can get:


    
- a-χʲa-z-batʂ&rsquo;a-ʁa-w-də-tʷ-aaj-la-fa-q&rsquo;a-jt&rsquo;-ma-da-χ
<br>
-~-<br>
_'If only you had not been able to make him take it all out from under me again for them!'_
    
This is a truly remarkable, and also absurd, feat of human linguistic ability. By any standard. Consisting of 16 parts{{< footnote dir=a ref="simplified-segmentation" >}}, this Ubykh expression is undoubtedly more complex than any word in any language you speak or know of. So of course, it seized my interest.

"Holy fucking shit," was I think my initial response, actually. If you're anything like me (hopefully you are NOT...), then perhaps you might also be a little sceptical, given this rather unbelievable level of complexity. I mean, it's actually pretty hard to work out what proposition is being expressed here. It involves something about someone taking something out from under someone else for another someone else, but I can't properly comprehend the situation it is describing. It really makes you wonder how, and in what context, a Ubykh speaker uttered this thing. Obviously, the first thing to do to learn more is go back to the original source. The _allthingslinguistic.com_ post didn't name a Ubykh source, so I checked the [SpecGram post](https://specgram.com/CLII.3/09.phlogiston.cartoon.3.html). All the references are fortunately listed at the bottom of that post, although strangely there's nothing specifically relating to Ubykh, only a few resources on polysynthesis more broadly. Upon checking all those resources, however, I tragically found no trace of this word, just a couple of general remarks about Caucasian languages broadly.

I thought that was rather odd. Where did it come from, then? Presumably SpecGram found it somewhere. Doing a little searching online, I couldn't find its original location, although I found the mega word cited in a range of educational resources, all of them appealing to its super-complexity:

Several other online posts mention it, too. What did intrigue me about these occurrences was that they vary in spelling. This puzzled me a little as there was no obvious reason why these mentions wouldn't simply use the spelling of the original source, whatever it was. The only one of these that cites any original Ubykh material at all is Evans, who references two works by Dumézil: _La Langue des Oubykhs_ (1931), and _Documents Anatoliens sur les Langues et les Traditions du Caucase, Vol. 2: Textes Oubykhs_ (1962). With the sources now in front of me, it was time to find out what I could about this mysterious thing.

So I did what any habitual procrastinator with a linguistics degree would do, and trawled meticulously through those books to find the original printing of this absolute behemoth. This was a rather difficult task, for two reasons. First, these books are entirely set in French. I don't speak any French. So I had to climb that barrier somehow. Second, Ubykh has a ridiculously large set of sounds. Only two vowels, but eighty-four consonants. Naturally, many unusual and not-standardly-typeable glyphs are used to represent these sounds{{< footnote dir=a ref="ubykh-phonemes" >}}, which made digitally searching the files extremely difficult. The orthographic system (i.e., the set of symbols used to represent the sounds) unhelpfully varies from publication to publication.

Of course, this was no deterrent, and I persisted. In an attempt to bypass the French problem, I decided my first strategy would be to word-search for _sous_ 'under(neath)', from the _"take it all out from under me..."_ part of the translation. Plenty of hits, none of them right. I tried _optatif_, since this is an optative ("if only ...!") construction. Nothing. I tried a bunch of other search terms but came up empty-handed each time. I looked through each chapter for Ubykh sentences and again, nothing. I was annoyed as much as I was baffled... my only lead turned out to be a dead end. So where _did_ this word come from? Clearly I had to expand my database for searching, and thus I collected every digitally available work on Ubykh I could find{{< footnote dir=a ref="ubykh-sources" >}}. One of these works, _Le Verbe Oubykh_, is dedicated entirely to verbs -- I was sure I'd find it in there, seeing as it's about as epic as a verb can get, but it wasn't. Text after text, search after search, I found nothing. Pieces of the big verb can be found around, but not the whole thing. For example, I found plenty of verbs incorporating the adverbial /bɜtɕ&rsquo;ɜ-/ 'under', and plenty of causative ("make X do Y") verbs, but none matching the target. Believe me, I looked in about every single place I could find; I cried my way through many, many chapters on Ubykh and relatives from obscure volumes on Caucasian languages, went down a billion rabbit holes on the phonology of these languages (hoping ultimately that Matt Gordon or John Colarusso had written just something on the prosody of complex verbs in Ubykh). Sadly these efforts were in vain.

My last hope was the reference grammar from 2011, published through LINCOM and authored by Rohan S. H. Fenwick from Brisbane (which is interesting to me, as I've never met any Australian linguists working on Caucasian languages{{< footnote dir=a ref="important-aussie" >}}). This is a fairly comprehensive description that synthesises what's been written about Ubykh previously, putting it in a format more familiar to linguists and providing new analyses of the phonology, morphology, and syntax. It's actually a very nice grammar and contains some fantastic analyses of the published material. Very unfortunately for me, I couldn't find any occurrence of _ɜ-χʲɜ-z-bɜtɕ’ɜ-ʁɜ-w-dɨ-tʷ-ɐj-lɜ-fɜ-q’ɜ-jt’-mɜ-dɜ-χ_. This troubled me deeply -- surely if it were anywhere, it would be this grammar. I find it difficult to accept that such a fantastic exemplar of morphological complexity would not be shown at least once. As with the other sources, the pieces of the verb are all in there but not the whole thing at once.

I was pulling out hair at this point. I could not believe my unsuccess, despite how comprehensive (I thought) my search was. After a brief period of feeling like a time-waster, my original suspicions began floating back up to the surface. What if _ɜ-χʲɜ-z-bɜtɕ’ɜ-ʁɜ-w-dɨ-tʷ-ɐj-lɜ-fɜ-q’ɜ-jt’-mɜ-dɜ-χ_ was actually a fabrication? Perhaps someone has done a Mark Baker{{< footnote dir=a ref="mark-baker" >}} and inferred its possibility by carefully examining the existing grammatical descriptions.

{{< footnote dir=b ref="polysynthesis" >}} What really counts as a _word_ in these languages anyway? 

{{< footnote dir=b ref="simplified-segmentation" >}} Actually, it only consists of 14 parts. Some of the segmentations from SpecGram are incorrect. For instance, 

{{< footnote dir=b ref="ubykh-phonemes" >}} One example is the labialised alveolopalatal ejective affricate /tɕʷ&rsquo;/, spelled by Dumézil as \<č&deg;&rsquo;\> in some texts and as \<ć̣ʷ\> in others. Another is the labialised and pharyngealised uvular ejective stop /qʷˤ&rsquo;/, spelled in some cases as \<qw\> and in others as \<q̄&deg;&rsquo;\>. You can see why searching directly for Ubykh text would be challenging.

{{< footnote dir=b ref="ubykh-sources" >}} The major descriptive works are (in order of publication): &para; _La Langue des Oubykhs_ (Dumézil, 1931); &para; _Le Verbe Oubykh_ (Dumézil &amp; Esenç, 1962); &para; _Textes Oubykhs_ (Dumézil, 1962); &para; _Dictionnaire de la Langue Oubykh_ (Vogt, 1963); &para; _Nouvelles Études Oubykh_ (Dumézil, 1965); &para; _Textes Oubykh_ (Dumézil &amp; Esenç, 1978); &para; _A Grammar of Ubykh_ (Fenwick, 2011).

{{< footnote dir=b ref="important-aussie" >}} This fact, as it turned out, was crucial.

{{< footnote dir=b ref="mark-baker" >}} Mark Baker, a linguist who has written extensively on theoretical aspects of polysynthesis, has done this in his own work. It's problematic, because in languages we often find that certain constructions that "should" exist (according to grammatical generalisations made by the analyst) but don't, for one reason or another. Often, the existence of an irregular or periphrastic form suppresses the expected form. In English, to take a simple example, we should 'expect' that
