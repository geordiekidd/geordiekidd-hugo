FlyLo's best album. Very psychedelic, very electronic, and very influential on me during my time as a musician. Simply fantastic production, with lots of textural and timbral diversity. The album is like an exploration into space and the after-life. Minimalists, be warned!

Favourite song: *German Haircut*.
