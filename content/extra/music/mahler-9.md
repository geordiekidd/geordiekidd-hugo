Breathtaking. A symphony with everything. I think Berg [said](https://web.archive.org/web/20080612134734/http://www.andante.com/profiles/Mahler/symph9.cfm) it best when he remarked: "The first movement is the most glorious [Mahler] ever wrote. It expresses an extraordinary love of this earth, for Nature; the longing to live on it in peace, to enjoy it completely, to the very heart of one's being, before death comes, as irresistibly it does." My favourite recording is [Claudio Abbado on DG with the Berlin Philharmonic](https://www.discogs.com/release/2822181-Gustav-Mahler-Berliner-Philharmoniker-Claudio-Abbado-Symphony-No-9?srsltid=AfmBOor8UwpPCE1yUsG3g-O0mvfbsXuDdXDS1UXz1dwdVSmMz9Gw3YC1), recorded live in 1999.
