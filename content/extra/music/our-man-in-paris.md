It's hard to believe that Dexter could've recorded anything better than *[Go](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=OLAK5uy_mDJkyLfBJx9yfctYhY9gWbyp5AmSDQhzs&si=biL5orNuKAvPN1hA)*, but he did. There's not much I can say about this album, other than that it's a contender for best Blue Note release of all time. Dex is in [peak form](https://youtu.be/QazbdfH6NI0?si=ECDpMNUuNjfODCPq&t=131), and the rest of the band swing their asses off. So, so good.

Favourite song: *Willow Weep for Me*.
