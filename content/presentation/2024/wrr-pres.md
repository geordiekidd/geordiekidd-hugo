This presentation represents the culmination of my research as a Summer Scholar at the Australian National University, a program I undertook in the summer of '23-24. The project involved semantic analysis of the complex verb system in Wardaman, an Australian language spoken in Katherine by two elderly people (at the time of writing). Wardaman is unusual amongst Australian complex verb languages, in that it has a rather large inventory of finite verbs, though not all of which can be complexified using coverbs. My research aimed to uncover which principles (if any) determine the combination of verb and coverb, and moreover why the Wardaman system is the way it is.
