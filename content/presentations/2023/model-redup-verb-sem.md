title: Modelling reduplicative verb semantics using lexical conceptual structure
---

This presentation is based on a paper I wrote for a third-year linguistics subject at the University of Melbourne, [LING30007: Semantics](https://handbook.unimelb.edu.au/2025/subjects/ling30007). My primary goal was to use Jackendoff's theory of boundedness and internal structure, as they relate to events, in a semantic treatment of verb reduplication in some Australian languages. Though the presentation is very limited in scope, it does set out some preliminary ideas for the semantic relationship between a verb and its reduplicated form.
