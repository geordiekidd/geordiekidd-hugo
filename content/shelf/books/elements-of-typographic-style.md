It's poetry about typography, really. Excellent historical overview and coverage of type and page design, and just fantastic prose throughout. 'Typographer's Bible' seems accurate. Many of the principles in there seem implicitly generalisable to designing space and shape in general, though, and I always take something new away from the book whenever I dive in.
