Strange and very introspective, this is (I believe) the only novel written by Rilke. It reads somewhat like a series of journal entries, and follows a young man around Paris while he makes sense of death and dying in the mysterious people around him. The prose is just fantastic, even if a little obscure at times. I have the translation by [Michael Hulse](https://www.penguin.com.au/books/the-notebooks-of-malte-laurids-briggs-9780141182216), though I've heard good things about the one by [Edward Snow](https://wwnorton.com/books/9780393882087), who is my favourite translator of Rilke's poetry.
