I might be a little biased about this one, but it really is a thoroughly enjoyable exploration of the morphology and phonology of a very complex Australian language. I don't agree with all of the analyses, and the theoretical framework in which it is written is outdated, but the argumentation is exemplary and the phenomena it tackles are of enduring intrigue.
