Some of the best yet most torturous cinema you will ever watch. This is a Polish series of ten hour-long films that are loosely based on the ten commandments. Travelling to the edges of human relationships, morality, consequence, love, despite, ego, fate, and uncertainty, Kieślowski's *Dekalog* has everything. Exceptionally written and directed. If I had to recommend only one work from KK, this would be it. (Thankfully, this is my website and I can recommend more than one if I like.) Dekalog 6 (about Love) is horrifyingly beautiful.
