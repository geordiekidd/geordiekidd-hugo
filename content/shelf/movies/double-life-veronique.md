A very charming movie about fate, love, and identity, and emblematic of late Kieślowski's style. Like the [Three Colours trilogy](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/844-three-colors?srsltid=AfmBOoqgOOzx47jdyieEFGksm4CdTse4WXDQz7SEfGzu_a1wMN8So-vM) that followed it (which is also a must-watch), *Double Life* is about people making sense of the strange and mystical world around them. It also focuses on the rather enchanting nature of coincidence, which I really like.
