Well, what is there to say that has not elsewhere been said? A film of truly exceptional (motivic and visual) beauty, it captures so perfectly the tension, confusion, suppression, and painful longing of mis-fortunate love. Performances by Maggie Cheung and Tony Leung must rank amongst the best ever. Probably my desert island pick, if I had to choose.
