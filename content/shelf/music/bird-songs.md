A housemate quietly dropped Bedouine's music on my doorstep one day, and I have been grateful ever since. This is a beautiful album with beautiful lyrics and beautiful arrangements. It tends to come on whenever I need a break from the things around me and want to relax.

Favourite song: *Bird Gone Wild*.
