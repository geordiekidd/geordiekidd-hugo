It doesn't really get much better than this! Contrary to what some people think, I reckon every song on this album is perfect. Nancy Wilson offers what should be considered the definitive vocal recordings of these tunes. An incredible voice. Credit also goes to whoever arranged the tunes for the album (I believe it was Nat Adderley).

Favourite song: *Save Your Love for Me*.
