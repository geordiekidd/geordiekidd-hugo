Though its sound might be considered dated today, to me this album is an absolutely timeless classic. A beautiful and haunting exhibition of human feelings, there aren't many (or any?) other albums out there that sound quite like this one. Mum used to play it a lot when I was a kid, but I still love it. Bj&ouml;rk is my favourite singer and this is my favourite work of hers, by far.

Favourite song: *Big Time Sensuality*, or *Like Someone in Love*.
