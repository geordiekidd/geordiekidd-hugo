To me this album is an absolutely timeless classic. A beautiful and haunting exhibition of human feelings, there aren't many (or any?) other albums out there that sound quite like this one. Mum used to play it a lot when I was a kid, and I still love it. Bj&ouml;rk is my all time favourite singer and this is my favourite work of hers, by far.

Favourite songs: *Big Time Sensuality*, and *Like Someone in Love*.
