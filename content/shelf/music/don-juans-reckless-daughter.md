This is by far the best Joni Mitchell album, I think because of the sophisticated and eclectic set list but also the journey it constructs. Like lots of her music, but perhaps the most so, this is an album that firmly resists genre labels; it's a very (musically and thematically) adventurous album, and that's perhaps why I'm drawn to it.

Favourite songs: _Cotton Avenue_, and _The Tenth World_.
