Picking one Stevie Wonder album to showcase here is like torture to me, so I cheated and put everything from Talking Book through Songs in the Key of Life here. Still, Innervisions might be my favourite of the four. I think Stevie is one of the greatest songwriters of all time, and definitely one of the greatest composers of the 20th century. Endless harmonic genius on display in these albums, plus some of the best grooves you will ever hear.
