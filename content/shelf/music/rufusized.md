Rufusized is one of my favourite funk albums of all time. I'd like to say I equally love all the Rufus and Chaka Khan albums from the 70s, but this is the one I find myself coming back to most often. Impeccable groove throughout, and Chaka Khan makes a compelling case for best voice of the decade. 

Favourite song: *Somebody's Watching You*.
