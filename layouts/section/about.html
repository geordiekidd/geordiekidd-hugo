        Here's a little bit about me: I'm a linguistics graduate from the University of Melbourne, and I live and work on Wurundjeri country. You might've gauged some of my academic interests by <a href="/writing/">reading</a> my <a href="/presentations/">work</a>, but if not, I'm fascinated by the phonology and semantics of Australian Indigenous languages, as well as speech processing and theories of morphology and the lexicon.

        In my daily life: I love to walk and be outside; I listen to lots of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Euo2PLEuU0">jazz</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mXcdpPDHzlM">funk</a> music; I am vegetarian and I like to cook; I prefer to write on a manual <a href="https://typewriterdatabase.com/1968-hermes-3000.3943.typewriter">typewriter</a> or with a <a href="https://www.gentlemanstationer.com/blog/2024/4/6/fountain-pen-review-the-curious-case-of-the-lamy-vista">fountain</a> <a href="https://www.twsbi.com/collections/fountain-pens/products/twsbi-eco-glow-green-fountain-pen">pen</a>; I am a satisfied <a href="https://neovim.io">neovim</a> convert; I quite enjoy <a href="https://www.whiskybase.com/whiskies/whisky/202641/ardbeg-ardcore">whisky</a>; I will always advocate for well-typeset documents; my goal is to meditate and be grateful for something every day.
